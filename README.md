This is a tweak to the original Android `RadioGroup.java` class. This is because the original RadioGroup is only able to do:

And it is **not** able to do this:

With `RadioGroupPlus`, you can do this:

Doc
-------
Everything should function the same as the original `RadioGroup`, so refer to this: [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RadioGroup.html](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RadioGroup.html)

Demo
-------
Refer to `app/` folder of this repo.

Usage
-------
Simple example:

```
   <worker8.com.github.radiogroupplus.RadioGroupPlus
        android:id="@+id/radio_group_plus"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:orientation="vertical">
        <LinearLayout...>
           <ImageView...>
           <TextView...>
           <RadioButton...>
        </LinearLayout>
        <LinearLayout...>
           <ImageView...>
           <TextView...>
           <RadioButton...>
        </LinearLayout>
        <LinearLayout...>
           <ImageView...>
           <TextView...>
           <RadioButton...>
        </LinearLayout>
   </worker8.com.github.radiogroupplus.RadioGroupPlus>
```

Explanation: the 3 `RadioButton` shown in the code above will be linked together by `RadioGroupPlus` automatically.

If you want a even weirder layout, it will also work, for example:

    <worker8.com.github.radiogroupplus.RadioGroupPlus
        android:id="@+id/radio_group_plus"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:orientation="vertical">
        <LinearLayout...>
           <ImageView...>
           <TextView...>
           <RadioButton...>
        </LinearLayout>
        <LinearLayout...>
           <ImageView...>
           <TextView...>
           <RadioButton...>
        </LinearLayout>
        <LinearLayout...>
          <RelativeLayout>
             <ImageView...>
             <TextView...>
             <RadioButton...>
          </RelativeLayout>
          <RelativeLayout>
             <ImageView...>
             <TextView...>
             <RadioButton...>
          </RelativeLayout>
        </LinearLayout>
    </worker8.com.github.radiogroupplus.RadioGroupPlus>

Now the 2 `RadioButton` under the `LinearLayout` and the 2 `RadioButton` inside the `RelativeLayout` will all be linked together.

In fact, there is no limitation to what the layout should look like, because `RadioGroupPlus` will just look for all the `RadioButton` in it's children and link them together.

How it works / Contribute
-------
You don't actually need to read this part unless you are interested or you want to contribute or fix this repo. I wrote a simple `TreeTraversel` to traverse all the children that will be added to `RadioGroupPlus`, a Pre-order traversal is used but there is no special reason of why because it doesn't really matter in this case. 

While traversing, the listener `mChildOnCheckedChangeListener` is added to the `RadioButton`, so when the `RadioButton` is clicked, `mChildOnCheckedChangeListener` will be called, and `CheckedStateTracker#onCheckedChanged` will be called to properly toggle the `RadioButton`s.

In short, look for `traverseTree()` in [](https://github.com/worker8/RadioGroupPlus/blob/master/radiogroupplus/src/main/java/worker8/com/github/radiogroupplus/RadioGroupPlus.java) if you want to make changes.


Download/Install
-------
Add this to **top** level `build.gradle`:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }

Add this under dependencies:

    implementation 'com.github.worker8:radiogroupplus:v1.0.1'

If you run into conflict, use this instead:

    implementation('com.github.worker8:radiogroupplus:v1.0.1') {
        transitive = false;
    }
